# carl-johnson-binco-website (WIP)
This is my first project creating a website, i'm trying to focus on how to design using CSS for the first time. This website has 3 page consist of home, store, and about page.

# Difficulty
One of diffuclty i face along while working on the website is working on the footer, the footer is not interactive enough as i zoom out and decrease the margin of the footer, it won't stay stick at the very bottom of the screen.

# Solution
Again, i'm still learning about CSS, the whole progress designing a website (front-end) is new to me. I will try to fix the difficulties i'm having while designing this website, one of them are the footer problem. This readme file will keep updating until the website is finished.
